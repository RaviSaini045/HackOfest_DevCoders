# Public Sphere

Public Sphere is a Citizen Reporting and Monitoring System (CRMS) designed to foster transparency, accountability, and citizen empowerment in governance. The platform aims to revolutionize the way citizens engage with their government and actively participate in shaping their communities for the better.

## Use Case
* Situation: Yash, a resident of Patna, is eager to know about the progress and completion date of a new bridge being built by the central government, which is causing significant traffic congestion in the area.

* Problem: Yash faces challenges in obtaining timely and accurate information about the bridge construction project from traditional sources, leading to frustration and uncertainty about the traffic situation.

* Solution: Our platform provides a dedicated section for citizens like Yash to access real-time updates and project details, allowing him to easily track the status of the bridge construction and stay informed about milestones and completion timelines.
