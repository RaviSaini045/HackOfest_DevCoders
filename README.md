# Public Sphere

Public Sphere is a Citizen Reporting and Monitoring System (CRMS) designed to foster transparency, accountability, and citizen empowerment in governance. The platform aims to revolutionize the way citizens engage with their government and actively participate in shaping their communities for the better.
